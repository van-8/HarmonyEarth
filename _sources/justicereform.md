# Justice Reform

## Born a Crime, by Trevor Noah
Quote Chapter 17 "The World Doesn't Love You" to create empathy for dignity and justice.

Trevor's mom says:

I know you see me as some crazy old bitch nagging at you, but you forget the reason I ride you so hard and give you so much shit is because I love you. Everything I have ever done I"ve don from a place of love. If I don't punish you, the world will punish you even worse. The world doesn't love you. If the police get you, the police don't love you. When I beta you, I'm trying to save you. When they beat you, they're trying to kill you.
