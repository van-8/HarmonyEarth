# Great Responsibility 

Storytellers scaffold people's reality. With this great power comes great responsibility, legally called a duty of care. An obligation to reduce preventable harm.

Civilization is a fragile interdependent foundation? of domain professionals, providing and protecting non-professionals. Providing clean water, treating waste, food, healthcare, public safety, electricity, internet.

## Filmmaking ruining lives

Shelley Duvall by Stanely Kubrick, [bat scene took 127 takes](https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-shining-shelley-duvall-said-one-of-the-worst-days-of-her-life-was-while-shooting-this-one-scene.html/) taking until 5am.

“Going through day after day of excruciating work was almost unbearable,” said [Duvall to Rolling Stone in 1980](https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/shelley-duvall-and-stanley-kubrick-battle-the-shining-188549/). “Jack Nicholson’s character had to be crazy and angry all the time. And in my character, I had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week.” Filming the movie had extended way overtime, and because of this, Duvall was separated from her family for a whole year. 

Dr Phil exploiting Shelley Duvall. [Ronan Farrow pleads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvBeDmMWjS8) and Vivian Kubrick quote.

Dr Oz touting misinformation. 

Tabloids should be regulated like pornography. The subjects should be fully consenting to be used as entertainment. Paparazzi are disgusting. 

## Retiring bad concepts

Caricatures. By citizenship or gender or occupation or physical appearance. 

Race.
