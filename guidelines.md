## Deiter Rams - Gutes Design
https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design

1. Gutes Design ist innovativ

Die Möglichkeiten für Innovation sind längst nicht ausgeschöpft. Die technologische Entwicklung bietet immer wieder neue Ausgangspunkte für zukunftsfähige Gestaltungskonzepte, die den Gebrauchswert eines Produktes optimieren. Dabei entsteht innovatives Design stets im Zusammenschluss mit innovativer Technik und ist niemals Selbstzweck.

Good design is innovative

The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.

2. Gutes Design macht ein Produkt brauchbar

Man kauft ein Produkt, um es zu benutzen. Es soll bestimmte Funktionen erfüllen – Primärfunktionen ebenso wie ergänzende psychologische und ästhetische Funktionen. Gutes Design optimiert die Brauchbarkeit und lässt alles unberücksichtigt, was nicht diesem Ziel dient oder ihm gar entgegensteht.

Good design makes a product useful

A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.


3. Gutes Design ist ästhetisch

Die ästhetische Qualität eines Produktes ist integraler Aspekt seiner Brauchbarkeit. Denn Geräte, die man täglich benutzt, prägen das persönliche Umfeld und beeinflussen das Wohlbefinden. Schön sein kann aber nur, was gut gemacht ist.

Good design is aesthetic

The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.

4. Gutes Design macht ein Produkt verständlich

Es verdeutlicht auf einleuchtende Weise die Struktur des Produkts. Mehr noch: Es kann das Produkt zum Sprechen bringen. Im besten Fall erklärt es sich dann selbst.

Good design makes a product understandable

It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.


5. Gutes Design ist unaufdringlich

Produkte, die einen Zweck erfüllen, haben Werkzeugcharakter. Sie sind weder dekorative Objekte noch Kunstwerke. Ihr Design sollte deshalb neutral sein, die Geräte zurücktreten lassen und dem Menschen Raum zur Selbstverwirklichung geben.

Good design is unobtrusive

Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.


6. Gutes Design ist ehrlich

Es lässt ein Produkt nicht innovativer, leistungsfähiger, wertvoller erscheinen, als es in Wirklichkeit ist. Es versucht nicht, den Verbraucher durch Versprechen zu manipulieren, die es dann nicht halten kann.

Good design is honest

It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.

7. Gutes Design ist langlebig

Es vermeidet, modisch zu sein, und wirkt deshalb nie antiquiert. Im deutlichen Gegensatz zu kurzlebigem Mode-Design überdauert es auch in der heutigen Wegwerfgesellschaft lange Jahre.

Good design is long-lasting

It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today’s throwaway society.


8. Gutes Design ist konsequent bis ins letzte Detail

Nichts darf der Willkür oder dem Zufall überlassen werden. Gründlichkeit und Genauigkeit der Gestaltung sind letztlich Ausdruck des Respekts dem Verbraucher gegenüber.

Good design is thorough down to the last detail

Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user.

9. Gutes Design ist umweltfreundlich

Design leistet einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Erhaltung der Umwelt. Es bezieht die Schonung der Ressourcen ebenso wie die Minimierung von physischer und visueller Verschmutzung in die Produktgestaltung ein.

Good design is environmentally-friendly

Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.

10. Gutes Design ist so wenig Design wie möglich

Weniger Design ist mehr, konzentriert es sich doch auf das Wesentliche, statt die Produkte mit Überflüssigem zu befrachten.

Zurück zum Puren, zum Einfachen!

Good design is as little design as possible

Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.

Back to purity, back to simplicity.



## Joss Whedon 10 Writing Tips
Catherine Bray interview in 2006 for movie magazine Hotdog.

1. **Finish it.** Actually finishing it is what I'm gonna put in as step one. You may laugh at this, but it's true. I have so many friends who have written two-thirds of a screenplay, and then re-written it for about three years. Finishing a screenplay is first of all truly difficult, and secondly really liberating. Even if it's not perfect, even if you know you're gonna have to go back into it, type to the end. You have to have a little closure. 

2. **Structure.** Structure means knowing where you're going; making sure you don't meander about. Some great films have been made by meandering people, like Terrence Malick and Robert Altman, but it's not as well done today and I don't recommend it. I'm a structure nut. I actually make charts. Where are the jokes? THe thrills? THe romance? Who knows what, and when? You need these things to happen at the right times, and that's what you build your structure around: the way you want your audience to feel. Charts, graphs, coloured pens, anything that means you don't go blind is useful.

3. Have something to say. This really should be number one. Even if you're writing a Die Hard rip-off, have something to say about Die Hard rip-offs. The number of movies that are not about what they purport to be about is staggering. It's rare, especially in genres, to find a movie with an idea and not just, "This'll lead to many fine set-pieces'. The Island evolves into a car-chase movie, and the moments of joy are when they have clone moments and you say, 'What does it feel like to be those guys?"

4. Everybody has a reason to live. Everybody has a perspective. Everybody in your scene, including the thug flanking your bad guy, has a reason. They have their own voice, their own identity, their own history. If anyone speaks in such a way that they're just setting up the next person's lines, then you don't get dialogue: you get soundbites. Not everybody has to be funny; not everybody has to be cute; not everybody has to be delightful, and not everybody has to speak, but if you don't know who everybody is and why they're there, why they're feeling what they're feeling and why they're doing what they're doing, then you're in trouble. 

5. Cut what you love. Here's one trick that I learned early on. If something isn't working, if you have a story that you've built and it's blocked and you can't figure it out, take your favorite scene, or your very best idea or set-piece, and cut it. It's brutal, but sometimes inevitable. That thing may find its way back in, but cutting it is usually an enormously freeing exercise. 

6. Listen. WHen I've been hired as a script doctor, it's usually because someone else can't get it through to the enxt level. It's true that writers are replaced when executives don't know what else to do, and that's terrible, but the fact of the matter is that for most of the screenplays I"ve worked on, I've been needed, whether or not I've been allowed to do anything good. Often someone's just got locked, they've ossified, they're so stuck in their heads that they can't see the people around them. It's very important to know when tot stick to your guns, but it's also very important to listen to absolutely everybody. The stupidest person in the room might have the best idea. 

7. Track the audience mood. You have one goal: to connect with your audience. Therefore, you must track what your audience is feeling at all times. One of the biggest problems I face when watching other people's movies is I"ll say, 'THis part confuses me', or whatever, and they'll say 'What I'm intending to say is this', and they'll go on about their intentions. None of this has anything to do with my experience as an audience member. Think in terms of what audiences think. They go to the theater and they either notice that their butts are numb, or they don't. If you're doing your job right, they don't. People think of studio test screenings as terrible, and that's because a lot of studios are pretty stupid about it. They panic and re-shoot, or they go, "Gee, Brazil can't have an unhappy ending,' and that's the horror story. But it can make a lot of sense. 

8. Write like a movie. Write the movie as much as you can. If something is lush and extensive, you can describe it glowingly; if something isn't that important, just get past it tersely. Let the read feel like the movie; it does a lot of the work for you, for the director, and for the executives who go, "What will this be like when we put it on its feet?"

9. Don't listen. Having given advice about listening, I have to give the opposite advice, because ultimately the best work comes when somebody's fucked the system; done the unexpected and let their own personal voice into the machine that is movie-making. Choose your battles. You wouldn't get Paul Thomas Anderson, or Wes Anderson, or any of these guys if all movie-making was completely cookie-cutter. But the process drives you in that direction; it's a homogenizing process, and you have to fight that a bit. THere was a point while we were making Firefly when I asked the network not to pick it up: they'd started talking about a different show. 

10. Don't sell out. The first penny I ever earned, I saved. Then I made sure that I never had to take a job just because I needed to. I still needed jobs of course, but i was able to take ones that I loved. When I say that includes Waterworld, people scratch their heads, but its a wonderful idea for a movie. Anything can be good. Even Last Action Hero could've been good. There's an idea somewhere in almost any movie: if you can find something that you love, then you can do it. If you can't, it doesn't matter how skillful you are: that's called whoring. 

Emma Coats Storyboard Artist 

1. You admire a character for trying more than for their successes
2. You gotta keep in mind what's interesting to you as an audience, not what's fun to do as a writer. They can be very different.
3. Trying for theme is important, but you won't see what the story is actually about til you're at the end of it. Now rewrite.
4. Once upon a time there was __. Every day, __. One day __. Because of that, __. Because of that, __. Until finally __.
5. Simplify. FOcus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You'll feel like you're losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.
6. What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?
7. Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.
8. Finish your story, let go even if it's not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time. 
9. WHen you're stuck, make a list of what WOULDN'T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.
10. Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a apart of you; you've got to recognize it before you can use it.
11. Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you'll never share it with anyone.
12. Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th- get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.
13. Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likeable to you as a write, but it's poison to the audience.
14. Why must you tell THIS story? What's the belief burning with you that your story feed off of? That's the heart of it.
15. If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.
16. What are the stakes? GIve us reason to root for the character. What happens if they don't succeed? Stack the odds against.
17. No work is ever wasted. If its not working, let go and move on- it'll come back around to be useful later. 
18. You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best and fussing. Story is testing, not refining. 
19. Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.
20. Exercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How d'you rearrange them into what you DO like?
21. You gotta identify with your situation/characters, can't just write 'cool'. What would make YOU act that way?
22. What the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build out from there.
