# HarmonyEarth

Storytelling guidelines for a harmonious future to prevent WW3.. 

Produce a truly intercultural, multilingual sci-fi "Star Trek" that de-glorifies violence, glamorizes discourse, and villanizes incompetence/hypocrisy instead of identity. These cinematic parables ethically navigate making mistakes, learning new evidence, then displaying responsibility, reorientation, and reconciliation. Each episode showcases coooperation in spite of cultural dissimilarities, with characters hailing from all corners of Earth with special emphasis on China, US, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Nigeria.

Harmonious future = hafu?

The adventure to improve the wellbeing of conscious beings of Earth.

# Terminology

(priors)=
## Priors
The expectations and past experiences a person brings to a certain situation. For example: languages they understand, familiarity with a situation, cultural expectations, etc. Priors feed into predictions. The term comes from Bayesian statistical inference.

(users)=
## Users
Watching and listening are not passive actions. Just as with an app or a device, a person brings their {term}`priors`, predictions, and affect to the story. Deprecate the terms "audience" and "viewer."

(intend)=
## Intend
The brain does not have "circuits" or "parts" for sadness or happiness. There is nothing for experineers to "turn on." So we can only *intend* to nudge towards a certain affective state, conceptual memory, or other prior.

Nudging towards.

(perceive)=
## Perceive
Brain states cannot be recognized, they can only be perceived. {ref}`users` guess at each others brain state.
